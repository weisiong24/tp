The greeting screen of WhereGotTime is preceded by Storage initialisation messages that indicate if previously saved data, if any, is 
loaded successfully.

For example, if this is your first time running the application, the expected greeting screen is as follows:
```
Data folder not found! Creating one...
No existing WhereGotTime.txt found! Creating one...
Storage initialisation completed without issue.

```

Note that the Storage initialisation message is dependent on the status of WhereGotTime.txt, for example, if this is second time using the application,
and provided that the folder containing the previously stored information is not altered, the expected output is as follows:
```
Data folder found! Finding WhereGotTime.txt...
Existing WhereGotTime.txt found. Loading previously saved timetable information...
Timetable information loaded successfully!
Storage initialisation completed without issue.
```



### Viewing help menu: `help`

- 'day' should be 3-letter, e.g. Mon, TUE, wed, etc.

    1. either one is not in 4-digit format (e.g. 09000)
    2. either one is not in 1-hour block (e.g. 0903)
    3. either one has invalid hours and minutes (e.g. 2861, 0989)
    4. both are identical (e.g. 0900-0900)
    5. start time is later than end time (e.g. 1100-0900)
